# Flexbox Exercise

This repo contains a partially styled webpage, along with a design.png file. Your task is attempt to replicate the design.
Feel free to make any changes to the existing HTML and CSS you think are necessary. Changes to the HTML may or may not be required.
Feel free to use any colours you want, and spacing distances do not need to match the design exactly.

## Navbar styling

    - The first column should take up 2/3 and the second 1/3
